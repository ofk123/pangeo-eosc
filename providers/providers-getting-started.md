# How to deploy `pangeo-eosc` services yourself?

In this section you will learn how to deploy `pangeo-eosc` services
in the [European Open Science Cloud](https://eosc-portal.eu/about).

We currently offer two options:
* [Deployment using a virtualised kubernetes on top of OpenStack](./openstack/README.md)
* [Deployment using a baremetal kubernetes](./kubernetes/README.md)

Both deployments have been carried out in the context of the following projects:
* [EGI-ACE](https://www.egi.eu/project/egi-ace/)
* [C-SCALE](https://c-scale.eu/)
